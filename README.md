# Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services

## Building a RAG-Powered Chatbot to Turn Customer Feedback into Actionable Insights

### Business Objective

CrediTrust Financial is a fast-growing digital finance company serving East African markets through a mobile-first platform. Their offerings include:

- **Credit Cards**
- **Personal Loans**
- **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)**
- **Savings Accounts**
- **Money Transfers**

With over 500,000 users and operations in three countries, CrediTrust receives thousands of customer complaints each month through various channels. Your mission is to develop an internal AI tool that transforms unstructured complaint data into actionable insights. This tool will benefit internal stakeholders such as Asha, a Product Manager, who currently spends excessive time analyzing complaints.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for success:
- Reduce the time for Product Managers to identify complaint trends from days to minutes.
- Enable non-technical teams to access insights without data analyst support.
- Shift the company from a reactive to a proactive approach in addressing customer feedback.

### Motivation

CrediTrust's internal teams face significant challenges:
- Overwhelmed Customer Support due to high complaint volume.
- Difficulty for Product Managers in identifying critical issues.
- Reactive Compliance & Risk teams missing emerging fraud signals.
- Executives lacking visibility into pain points from scattered complaint narratives.

The goal is to build an intelligent complaint-answering chatbot that empowers teams to quickly understand customer pain points across key product categories.
